# GreynirSeq

GreynirSeq is a natural language parsing toolkit for Icelandic focused on sequence modeling with neural networks. It is under active development and is in its early stages.

The modeling part (nicenlp) of GreynirSeq is built on top of the excellent [fairseq](https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq) from Facebook (which is built on top of pytorch).

GreynirSeq is licensed under the MIT license unless otherwise stated at the top of a file. Model files hosted by Miðeind or on Hugging Face are under the GNU AFFERO GPLv3 license unless released elsewhere under CC-BY, e.g. on CLARIN.

---

Be aware that usage of the CLI or otherwise downloading model files will result in downloading of **gigabytes** of data.
Simply installing `greynirseq` will not download any models, they are automatically downloaded on-demand.

## Installation
In a suitable virtual environment
``` bash
# From PyPI
$ pip install greynirseq
# or from git main branch
$ pip install git+https://github.com/mideind/greynirseq@main
```

## Features

### TL;DR give me the CLI

The `greynirseq` CLI interface can be used to run pretrained models for various tasks. Run `pip install greynirseq && greynirseq -h` to see what options are available.

#### POS
Input is accepted from file containing a single [tokenized](https://github.com/mideind/Tokenizer) sentence per line, or from stdin.

``` bash
$ echo "Systurnar Guðrún og Monique átu einar um jólin á McDonalds ." | greynirseq pos --input -

nvfng nven-s c n---s sfg3fþ lvfnsf af nhfog af n----s pl
```

#### NER
Input is accepted from file containing a single [tokenized](https://github.com/mideind/Tokenizer) sentence per line, or from stdin.

``` bash
$ echo "Systurnar Guðrún og Monique átu einar um jólin á McDonalds ." | greynirseq ner --input -

O B-Person O B-Person O O O O O B-Organization O
```

#### Translation
Input is accepted from file containing a single **untokenized** sentence per line, or from stdin.

``` bash
# For en->is translation
$ echo "This is an awesome test that shows how to use a pretrained translation model." | greynirseq translate --source-lang en --target-lang is

Þetta er æðislegt próf sem sýnir hvernig nota má forprófað þýðingarlíkan.

# For is->en translation
$ echo "Þetta er æðislegt próf sem sýnir hvernig nota má forprófað þýðingarlíkan." | greynirseq translate --source-lang is --target-lang en

This is an awesome test that shows how a pre-tested translation model can be used.
```

### Neural Icelandic Language Processing - NIceNLP

IceBERT is an Icelandic BERT-based (RoBERTa) language model that is suitable for fine tuning on downstream tasks.

The following fine tuning tasks are available both through the `greynirseq` CLI and for loading programmatically.

1. [POS tagging](https://github.com/mideind/GreynirSeq/blob/main/src/greynirseq/nicenlp/examples/pos/README.md)
1. [NER tagging](https://github.com/mideind/GreynirSeq/blob/main/src/greynirseq/nicenlp/examples/ner/README.md)

There are also a some translation models available. They are Transformer models trained from scratch or finetuned based on mBART25.

## Development
To install GreynirSeq in development mode install it with pip in editable mode

```bash
pip install -e .
```

### Linting

All code is checked with [Super-Linter](https://github.com/github/super-linter) in a *GitHub Action*, we recommend running it locally before pushing

```bash
./run_linter.sh
```

### Type annotation

Type annotation will soon be checked with mypy and should be included.
